Payday loans are expensive, high-interest loans with short repayment periods that can be difficult to repay on time. Borrowers who are unable to make payments may opt to roll over their loan for a fee. With enough rollovers, this could mean owing more than the initial loan amount.

If youâ€™re struggling to manage multiple payday loan payments, payday loan consolidation may be an option to consider.
