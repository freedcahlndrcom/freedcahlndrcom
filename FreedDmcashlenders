Payday loan consolidation is when you combine multiple existing payday loans under one new personal loan, which you pay off in monthly installments at a lower interest rate.

Consolidating payday loans with a lower-interest personal loan gives you a longer repayment period and small monthly payments that are easier to manage. In addition, paying down one loan instead of multiple can feel less overwhelming and help you stick to your debt payoff plan.
